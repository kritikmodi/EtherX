# EtherX

An Ethereum-based cryptocurrency wallet made using Flutter.

This minimal wallet helps the user to store Ethereum-based coins and transfer them between different addresses.

We have used Firebase(`firebase_auth` package) for authenticating the user and logging him in/out.

### Front-end :

- Flutter and Dart for the complete project.
- `velocity_x` Dart package for designing the homepage of the app.

### Back-end :

- MetaMask wallet as the sample/test wallet.
- Truffle for creating and deploying the Smart Contracts written in Solidity.
- Gnache for running a local Blockchain.
- Infura for deploying the Smart Contract on a test network.

##### Flutter packages used :

- `firebase_auth`
- `firebase_core`
- `web3dart`
- `velocity_x`
- `http`

The dependencies are present in the `pubspec.yaml` file. Use `flutter pub get` to get the dependencies before using the libraries' functions.
